# The Hangman game

### This is a simple command line 'Hangman' game.
You will need to guess the correct word within the maximum number of lives in order to win.

### Installation
This game requires python 3.10.6 or higher (possibly compatible with previous versions but untested).\
In order to install you can either clone this repository or download the files separately. It's important to note that if you decide to download the files separately, their directory tree must remain unaltered.

### Usage
The simpler way to run the game is to run ```main.py``` using ```python3 main.py```. You can modify ```main.py``` to use this game in other programs or change the behavior of the game. For example if you want to change the difficulty of the game, you can change the number of lives by calling ```Hangman.start_game()``` with a parameter: ```Hangman.start_game(10)``` will start the game with 10 lives instead of the default 5.
